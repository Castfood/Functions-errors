# myasseset

For this project, write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Description

This Solidity contract Implements the `require()`, `assert()` and `revert()` statements. These statements are commonly used for validating conditions and handling exceptions in smart contracts.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file:

There are three function in this contract setValue, incrementValue and decrenentValue they have `require()`, `assert()` and `revert()` statement respectively.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myasseset.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "myasseset" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
